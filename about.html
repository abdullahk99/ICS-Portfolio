I'll be honest, writing long paragraphs about myself has never been something im good at, but Ill try my best to give you guys some ideas of how cool I am.   </p>

                    7 years back, in grade 5, I had joined a computer technology club within my school which taught the basics of animation as well as how to function other basic related programs. I had not done to well in that specific competition that year, however, it helped built a much greater interest in what I wanted to do in the future. Now that I am in grade 11, I've realized how diffcult life is. I want to become a software engineer, but getting there is really hard, and every day I think if I will ever make it. As of now, Im focusing in school and trying to attend as many cool 'techy' events possible to learn as much as I can before studying becomes a day-night  job. </p>

                    yeah, thats me up there at my first every hackathon. It was 3 days of simple amazement, I got to meet so many new people that all for the best part of 3 days didnt get the chanse to sleep. I hope my future is as fun, and I do not turn out to be another simple emloyee for a big company. Let's see if I can become 'that big company' </p>

                    The dream is to make it into the profession of a software engineer, however, on this pathway I will face lots of difficulties. I want to have a plan for myself, what if things do not work out like I have dreamt they would? what will I do then? Work at Timmies? Thoughts like such scare me, and force me to think if I'll ever be successful. Engineering and programming have been an interest to me by a very little age, as this field holds so many opportunities for me in the future. I don't really have an answer to all of my questions currently; I'm currently just in grade 11 trying to keep my average up. In the process of attempting to understand and find the solutions to my hard problems as an 11 year old wanting to be successful, I recently found inspiration in a man who stands in a position I want to be in life, Casey Neistat.  He is a filmmaker, who owns the whole of an app named Beme, and posts daily vlogs on his YouTube channel. I do not want to copy his lifestyle, but his story starts off with him facing a lot if difficulties in life, however, he took risks to ensure that he did what he loves most in life. I want to be that risk taker and not be just another ordinary engineer, I want to be someone who people look up to and say: </p>
