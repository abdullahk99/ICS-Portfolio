                    <p class="main-text"> 
                    It has been a long hard fought 5 month journey being part of Computer Science this semester, and standing in the position I am in now, I couldnâ€™t be happier with my results. Last year In grade 10, during course selection, I remember my first pick being Computer Science after struggling for 20 minutes to find it located under the business department at North Park, but why? Before stepping my foot into this course, I already had a goal in mind of perusing my career into the pathway of IT, and I felt that computer science was the only possible way I could actually get hands on experience into such a field comparing into my other courses. I started off in September with absolutely zero knowledge of what was set ahead of me, however, I liked the atmosphere my teacher had started to form in the class from Day 1. The aspect of giving us an excessive amount of time to work on a semester-long project, in my view was excellent, as well as the other minor things we did in class such as Ted Talk Fridays or Mr. Brown calling us to the board to see the code had written for us to understand.  These small things all had huge impacts on my development in not only understanding the coding we were learning, but also more determination to move into the IT sector with inspiring views and points taken from Ted Talk/ Brown Talk Fridays, and I would like to say thank you to my teacher for granting making my future goals much more clear </p>
                    
                    <p class="main-text"> 
                   Looking through this course, I feel the highlight I would take from it is the complete polished understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I have developed. I knew nothing 5 months ago, and now when people ask me to examine their code, I feel like I have learned more then I would have ever expected. Everyday coming into Computer Science, I would want to complete some part of my code as a goal, most of the times I would find many obstacles in my way, but it is how I have learned to jump these obstacles is what is important. I think my complete understanding of these 3 coding languages is my most important highlight as this is what has allowed me to be confident in my work, and investigate new languages and opportunities, such as Hackathons! </p>
                    
            <h3 class="minor-header">What CS got me into</h3>


                    <p class="main-text"> 
                    I would have never had the guts to apply to a Hackathon if it was not for me building an app in Computer Science, and learning so many new aspects of code that I did not know at all just a few months prior. I acknowledged my ability to code after I was writing lines of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on the tip of my fingers, and decided to apply to Hack Western, a Hackathon located at Western University, which took over a span of 3 days and 2 nights. My application was accepted, along side my fellow classmate from ICS, Jevin, and we both decided to go! I can not begin to explain how much more I learned and developed over a span of just 3 days. I knew how to code an actual app using X-Code and posting it on the app store, how to use JavaScript to help the program understand different received signals from a motion sensor, and how a life of Software Engineer looks daily. Just learning 3 basic languages in a span of the first 3 months of this course has allowed me to assure my self of my future career, be confident in investigating applying to new opportunities, and most importantly make some very cool projects, thus this phase having the greatest impact on me as an individual in Computer Science.  </p>

              <h3 class="minor-header">All the bulbs that lit up for me</h3>
     
                    <p class="main-text"> 
                  As I move onto almost wrapping up my app, and I open all of the created files one more time to check if everything is clean and functional, I look back to realize how many hidden moments are berried under this code in which I was stumped and found a solution in the most bizarre fashion. I started off my making my log in page that separated a student and a teacher taking them to their desired home page, I remembered how many light bulbs switched on inside my head while writing that specific pages JavaScript! 
 </p>
                     <p class="main-text"> 

                    I had a lot of the bright moments Mr. Brown frequently talks about, and primarily these moments occurred during my process of completing the CSS and JavaScript of that specific page.  CSS was always a sweet challenge I liked to learn and face throughout this the process of completing my app, and the light bulbs above my head would flash as soon as I saw something align correctly on my page. However, during this process I have a huge regret, which I would have done completely different if I were to start this project again. Specifically this regret being my apps margins not cooperating once the screen was minimized, and now after going through this whole year I have understood the reasoning of this problem. The only way of fixing such margin error was to from the beginning have all the margins of my CSS attributes added on a page set to auto, or a certain percentage once minimized. This is something I look at now at definitely laugh at as I know my mistake, and to show my understanding, in the website I have created for this portfolio I have set margins for all attributes in a manor which makes minimizing the screen a possibility with everything remaining maintained in a decent position

                <h3 class="minor-header">How to solve problems in CS</h3>
            
        <p class="main-text"> 
                    Going back to the JavaScript I had written for the log in page of my app, I had a lot of problem making an interval function for a welcome message that appears on the users screen once he/she have entered the correct username and password. However, to solve this problem I used the great accessibility of W3 schools in my hands, and found out how to add an interval before the page proceeds with the function. Personally, I feel W3 Schools has allowed me to greatly excel in my understanding and allowed me to solve many problems, gaining moments that made me feel simmilar a bright indivisual.

             <h3 class="minor-header">A few steps away</h3>
    
        <p class="main-text"> 
          Stepping away from the amazing experiences I had during my construction of my website, My computer science teacher has assigned us with a project that allows us to slightly step away from the coding aspect of the course. Now we have been given another very cool task to complete over the winter vacations, and this time we are working in groups of 4! My group has chosen to investigate the health effects attached to the usage of computers. I completed some heavy research related to LED and CRT monitors. I learned how a Cathode Ray Tube emits radiation, and the process they use to do so. If you own a desktop monitor or even a TV that can be dated of creation a few years back, and you have it stored up in a deep cabinet, chances are it is a CRT. In these types of screens, as the electrons sweep across the surface of the screen, they emit radiation (x-ray frequencies). I like to talk about such projects completed over Computer Science, as this is an aspect that has made my experience in Computer science a whole lot better.

            <p class="main-text"> 
                To conclude my involvement In Computer Science has impacted my life in a very positive manor, as this has allowed me to excel greatly in various aspects in and out of school. There was many moments in Computer Science which had me stumped, confused which direction to go, however finding the correct pathway was just a part of the struggle and I feel this course does a great job helping us identify how to practically solve various sitiuations. I look to continue working with the same passion next year, and enhance my understating of code and aspects of CS.
